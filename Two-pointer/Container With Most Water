Container With Most Water

Given height[], find two indices i and j such that the area formed between them and the x-axis is maximized.

Formula for area = min(height[i], height[j]) * (j - i)

✅ Optimal Approach (Two Pointer) — O(n) Time
This is the one you implemented correctly above.

Start with two pointers at the ends of the array and move the smaller height inward to try to maximize area.

int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
    int i = 0, j = height.size() - 1, maxArea = 0;

    while (i < j) {
        int h = min(height[i], height[j]);
        maxArea = max(maxArea, h * (j - i));

        if (height[i] < height[j]) i++;
        else j--;
    }
    return maxArea;
}
🐢 Brute Force — O(n²) Time, O(1) Space
Try every pair of lines and calculate the area.
